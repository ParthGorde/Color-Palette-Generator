Color Palette Generator

A simple web app that generates random color palettes each time the spacebar is pressed. The generated colors are displayed in columns, with the text color changing automatically to ensure readability based on the brightness of the background color.

## Features:
- **Random Color Generation**: Press the spacebar to generate a new set of random colors.
- **Adaptive Text Color**: Text color changes automatically based on whether the background color is light or dark.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
